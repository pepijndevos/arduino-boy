# Bill's Arduino
*AVR based Pokemon storage and trading system*

[Demonstration](http://youtu.be/XlqMkfmCZfM)

For if you don't have friends that still play first generation Pokemon games.

It stores one Pokemon in EEPROM, allowing you to trade with a Game Boy.

Code should be compatible with most Arduino boards.

I liberally borrowed code form [gameboy-spoof](https://bitbucket.org/adanscotney/gameboy-spoof).
